            <p>The <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> tag is used when you have content on your website that is "marginal" to something, such as an article or a section of an article. This doesn't mean that the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag is always the sidebar on a website (it often is, though!), but it means that, similar to <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, it contains content that can stand on its own and is an addition to something on the website.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <code>

                </code>
            </div>

        </div>

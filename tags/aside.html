                <h1>The &lt;aside&gt; tag</h1>
            </header>

            <p>The <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag is used when you have content on your website that is "marginal" to something, such as an article or a section of an article. This doesn't mean that the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag is always the sidebar on a website (it often is, though!), but it means that, similar to <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, it contains content that can stand on its own and is an addition to something on the website. It is usually related to the main content it is included in.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <code>
                    &lt;p&gt;I like to eat tangerines.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <br><br>&lt;aside&gt;
                    <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;h2&gt;Tangerines&lt;/h2&gt;
                    <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Tangerines are orange-colored citrus fruits closely related to mandarin oranges.&lt;/p&gt;
                    <br> &lt;/aside&gt;
                </code>
            </div>

            <p>This is what it'll look like in your browser:</p>

            <div class="example">
                <p>I like to eat tangerines.</p>

                <aside>
                    <h2>Tangerines</h2>
                    <p>Tangerines are orange-colored citrus fruits closely related to mandarin oranges.</p>
                </aside>
            </div>

            <p>As you can see, style-wise, <code>aside</code> doesn't make a difference; it's shown just like anything else on the page. It is on you to add certain styling to it using CSS if you'd like to differentiate it from the main content. Such as the following:</p>

            <div class="example">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">I like to eat tangerines.</p>
                
                <aside style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px; display: inline-block; width: 200px; background-color: #fab1a0; text-align: justify;">
                    <h2 style="padding: 0; text-shadow: none;">Tangerines</h2>
                    <p>Tangerines are orange-colored citrus fruits closely related to mandarin oranges.</p>
                </aside>
            </div>

        </div>
    </body>
